 🎯 Computer Vision Toolkit with OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project is a collection of real-time computer vision applications using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**. It includes:

- 👁️ Face Detection  
- 🧠 Face Mesh Mapping  
- 🧍 Pose Estimation  
- ✋ Hand Tracking  
- 🔊 Gesture-Based Volume Controller

 📦 Features

 1. Face Detection
Detects human faces in real-time using MediaPipe or Haar cascades.

2. Face Mesh
Maps **468 landmarks** on a human face, useful for facial analysis, filters, AR, etc.

 3. Pose Estimation
Estimates human body posture in real-time with landmark detection on major joints (shoulders, knees, elbows, etc.).

 4. Hand Tracking
Tracks one or both hands, detecting 21 hand landmarks and supporting multi-hand recognition.

 5. Gesture Volume Controller
Uses hand gestures (distance between fingers) to control system volume dynamically.
